# Ideas

- the first building in the forestry quarter shoudld give some small base production or something as right now it isnt very useful off the start


- is there any resources in the game that one of these districts should give a bonus too
    - seems like the quarry resources are kind of ignored (stone, gypsum, marble etc.). maybe brick maker can give some production boosts to them?
    - R&F added few new resources that should be given bonuses to
    - See note about other resource mods below
    
- Mod dramatically increases the pace at which reasearch and buildings are built
   - Do we want to increase the cost of research/production to help slwo the game so a person isnt in the modern era but the 1300s
   - Seems like game pacing itself is really off, but the game plays well with the 8 Ages of Pace mod. No weird eras. Production and Gold do feel ridiculously accelerated, maybe we reduce some of the bonuses or change them to Food or Faith (Faith esp seems ignored a lot).

- Would be great if we could find someone to figure out how to get the buildngs to appear in the districts


# Extensions / Mod Support

- we should add extensions for resource mods like Sukritact's resources and Civitas Resources. I have started some work in the `resource_mods` branch.

- Have the loaded districts mod fixed to work with this mod, do you want to combine it with this mod as it adds a bunch of building to the base game districts
    - I like this idea, because Additional Buildings already adds a lot of buildings to city center. Maybe we need to beef up the districts more (need to think carefully about yields not being too overpowered)
