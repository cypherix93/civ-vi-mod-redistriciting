### New Buildings

~60+ new buildings, including buildings for (almost) all of the new districts, with unique abilities and icons. And more on the way.

### Trade Changes

All districts now have a COST and a PRODUCT for trade going both ways. Generally speaking, a district will try to sell whatever it makes on both incoming and outgoing routes.

### Known Issues
Icons for Bread, Sausage and Anchovies dont appear anywhere but the trade screen between civilizations, and no clue why.

Should work with most mods but mods with additional buildings or Districts have to be careful as names could be the same in both mods.
